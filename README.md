# mercedes
This repository contains Python code for the Kaggle Mercedes Benz competition submission. The main objective of this repository is
is to experiment with the Sci-kit learn API and try out sparse linear models (ridge, LASSO regression) on Kaggle. 
The Mercedes Benz dataset is an ideal test case for these methods because of the large number of variables which are not described. The high dimensionality of the data makes it very important to perform model selection and regularization somehow.
